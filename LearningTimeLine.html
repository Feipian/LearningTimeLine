            I was in the fourth or fifth grade when I
             first came across the game Minecraft.
              At that time, I thought plugins and modules were very novel.
               Why can the game have so many changes just by downloading other 
               people's Jar files? Maybe this is the reason why I I have a strong
                interest in coding and gradually develop towards coding
